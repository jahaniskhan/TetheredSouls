## Implementation Strategy:
1. Start with minimal viable versions
2. Layer complexity progressively
3. Use parallel processing where possible
4. Leverage reusable components
5. Implement base systems that scale

## Technical Approach:
- Use component-based architecture
- Implement pooling from start
- Layer animations on base systems
- Build expandable frameworks
- Use efficient state management

## Key to 5-Hour Success:
1. All systems start basic but complete
2. Polish layers on working features
3. No system blocks another
4. Parallel implementation
5. Scalable architecture

Original Story Points Preserved:
- All 110 points included
- Features generalized but present
- Systems designed for expansion
- No functionality removed
- Polish added incrementally

## Post-5-Hour Enhancement Path:
1. Animation refinement
2. Sound enhancement
3. Visual polish
4. Performance optimization
5. Feature expansion
