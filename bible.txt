# Teenage Engineering-Inspired Game Design Bible

## Core Design Philosophy
- **Reduction to Essence**: Strip away everything that isn't absolutely necessary
- **Playful Functionality**: Every element should be both useful and delightful
- **Industrial Warmth**: Combine mechanical precision with organic warmth
- **Tactical Feedback**: Design should feel physically responsive, even in digital space
- **Retro-Future Aesthetic**: Modern functionality meets vintage industrial design

## Color Palette

### Primary Colors
- Off-White: `#F5F5F1` (Main background/base color)
- Industrial Grey: `#2B2B2B` (Primary UI elements)
- Signal Orange: `#FF6B2B` (Accent/interactive elements)

### Secondary Colors
- Warm Beige: `#E5E1D8` (Secondary background)
- Charcoal: `#1A1A1A` (Deep shadows/contrast)
- Machine Yellow: `#FFB03B` (Secondary accent)
- Digital Green: `#4AFF8F` (System indicators)

## Typography
- Primary Font: Helvetica Neue or SF Pro Display
- Display Numbers: Custom monospace inspired by LED segments
- All text should be either Regular (400) or Bold (700)
- No italics, maintain geometric clarity

## UI Elements

### Blocks
- Hard-edged geometric shapes
- 2px minimum border radius
- Consistent 8px grid system
- Subtle shadow drops (2px offset maximum)

### Interactive Elements
- Clear state changes with color shifts
- Mechanical click animations (3-4 frames maximum)
- Audio feedback mimicking physical switches
- High contrast for active states

### Grid System
- Base unit: 8px
- Larger spacing increments: 16px, 24px, 32px
- Screen divisions should follow TE's preferred 3:2 ratio

## Animation Guidelines
- Quick, precise movements (150-200ms)
- No easing on basic interactions
- Step-based animations (like LED displays)
- Mechanical rather than organic motion

## Sound Design Principles
- Short, click-like feedback (50-100ms)
- High-frequency confirmation tones
- Low-frequency error indicators
- Synthesizer-inspired system sounds

## Interface Layout
- Maximum 3 levels of hierarchy
- Left-aligned text and elements
- Consistent spacing between sections
- Empty space as a design element

## Game-Specific Elements

### Block Design
- Minimal textures
- Hard edges with single-pixel highlights
- Limited color palette (3 colors per block maximum)
- Geometric patterns only

### HUD Elements
- Transparent backgrounds (`#2B2B2B` at 85% opacity)
- Single-pixel borders
- LED-style numerical displays
- Minimal animations

### Menu Systems
- Grid-based layout
- Toggle switches instead of buttons where possible
- Mechanical sliding transitions
- Clear visual hierarchy

## Anti-Patterns to Avoid
- Gradients or complex color blends
- Decorative elements without function
- Skeuomorphic textures
- Complex animations
- Rounded or organic shapes
- More than 3 interactive elements per group

## Implementation Rules
1. Always maintain 1:1 pixel accuracy
2. Use vector graphics where possible
3. Implement consistent click/hover states
4. Maintain minimum touch target size of 44x44px
5. Ensure all interactive elements have mechanical feedback


Based on the search results and Teenage Engineering's minimalist industrial design philosophy, I'll create a detailed README for a modern take on Oakever's Wood Block Puzzle game.

# BlockPuzzle™
*A minimalist block puzzle experience*

![Teenage Engineering inspired mockup]

## Overview
BlockPuzzle™ is a modern interpretation of the classic wood block puzzle game, featuring a clean monochromatic interface inspired by Teenage Engineering's industrial design philosophy. The game combines the addictive nature of block-fitting puzzles with social features and music integration.

## Core Gameplay Features

### Grid System
- 10x10 gameplay grid
- Minimalist monochrome blocks with subtle shadows
- High-contrast piece preview area
- Block holder section for strategic piece reservation
- Clean, vector-based grid lines with precise pixel alignment

### Block Mechanics
- Classic block shapes (T, L, J, Square configurations)
- Pieces cannot be rotated (following original gameplay)
- Drag-and-drop interaction with haptic feedback
- Line clearing animations with subtle particle effects
- Strategic piece holding system

### Scoring System
- Points awarded for each block placement
- Multiplier system for line clears
- Combo system (4+ line clears trigger special effects)
- Global leaderboard integration via Firebase
- Weekly challenges and achievements

## Technical Features

### Block Generation
```typescript
interface BlockShape {
  matrix: boolean[][];
  weight: number; // Probability weight
  color: string;
}

class BlockGenerator {
  private shapes: BlockShape[];
  private weightSum: number;
  
  generateNextBlock(): BlockShape {
    // Weighted random selection algorithm
    // Ensures balanced but unpredictable gameplay
  }
}
```

### Social Integration
- Real-time multiplayer matches via Firebase
- Friend challenges
- Score sharing
- Custom room creation
- In-game chat system

### Spotify Integration
